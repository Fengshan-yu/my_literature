      "TREM2(triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) knockout in PS19 mice reduced microgliosis, accompanied by preserved cortical volume without change in phospho-Tau levels.  (Strikingly, by 9 mo of age, T2−/−PS mice exhibited significantly less brain atrophy as quantified by ventricular enlargement and preserved cortical volume in the entorhinal and piriform regions compared with T2+/+PS mice. However, no TREM2- dependent differences were observed for phosphorylated tau staining or insoluble tau levels. Rather, T2−/−PS mice exhibited significantly reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus and piriform cortex comparedwith T2+/+PS mice. Gene expression analyses and immunostaining revealed microglial activation was significantly attenuated in T2−/−PS mice, and there were lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and astrogliosis. These unexpected findings suggest that impairing microglial TREM2 signaling reduces neuroinflammation and is protective against neurodegeneration in the setting of pure tauopathy. ; \n",
