FA was significantly decreased in the thalamic and hippocampal regions for 1 week as compared to the sham group. The reduced FA was consistently associated with increased expression of phosphorylated tau evident after day 1 in the white matter followed by its propagation to the gray matter within 1 week, in line with neuroinflammation; \n",

Consistently, we also found NfL increases in CSF and blood of human a-synucleinopathies, tauopathies, and Alzheimer’s disease.

      "presymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers have low mesial temporal volumes that are topographically similar to the atrophy pattern seen in symptomatic carriers. Low mesial temporal lobe volumes arose in about 20% of the presymptomatic carriers during their thirties, and regions with low gray matter appeared more common in presymptomatic carriers with each increasing decade. Fewer than 10% of presymptomatic carriers had low white matter values in affected regions. For symptomatic carriers, mesial temporal cortex was ubiquitously atrophied in carriers with a CDR plus NACC FTLD global score of 1 or greater, with widespread atrophy in frontotemporal cortex in those with more advanced symptoms. In MAPT mutation carriers, poorer memory performance was associated with lower hippocampal volume. We found that atrophy in frontotemporal and insular cortex and the uncinate fasciculi, inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and corpus callosum were commonly observed across different MAPT mutations during the symptomatic phase, with the exception of the R406W mutation carriers who lacked the frontal atrophy characteristic of other MAPT mutation carriers; \n",

(Strikingly, by 9 mo of age, T2−/−PS mice exhibited significantly less brain atrophy as quantified by ventricular enlargement and preserved cortical volume in the entorhinal and piriform regions compared with T2+/+PS mice. However, no TREM2- dependent differences were observed for phosphorylated tau staining or insoluble tau levels. Rather, T2−/−PS mice exhibited significantly reduced microgliosis in the hippocampus and piriform cortex comparedwith T2+/+PS mice. Gene expression analyses and immunostaining revealed microglial activation was significantly attenuated in T2−/−PS mice, and there were lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and astrogliosis. These unexpected findings suggest that impairing microglial TREM2 signaling reduces neuroinflammation and is protective against neurodegeneration in the setting of pure tauopathy. ; \n",

      "in the brain of individuals with AD, both the amount of neuron loss and the amount of NFTs in the disease-affected superior temporal sulcus correlate with the duration and severity of cognitive dysfunction, but the former exceeds the latter more than 7-fold. This suggests that neuronal loss, rather than NFTs, contributes directly to cognitive dysfunction in AD11. Further, several studies using tau transgenic mouse models have shown that synaptic function impairment and cognitive deficits occur before or without the formation of NFTs, and that switching off tau expression ameliorates memory impairment even though NFTs remain12,13,14. In addition, NFT-bearing neurons in the visual cortex function normally in electrophysiological studies15. Taken together, these findings suggest that soluble tau species, but not NFTs, could be responsible for cognitive dysfunction.  Δtau314 proteins are present in the inferior temporal gyrus of human brains; (2) Δtau314 proteins are generated from all six tau splicing isoforms, (3) levels of both Casp2 and Δtau314 proteins are elevated in cognitively impaired individuals compared to cognitively normal individuals, and (4) levels of Δtau314 proteins show a modest predictive value for dementia. These fndings advance our understanding of the characteristics of Δtau314 proteins and their relevance to cognitive dysfunction and shed light on the contribution of Casp2-mediated Δtau314 production to cognitive deterioration.; \n",

      "Therapies targeting late events in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and hyperphospho-rylated tau, have largely failed, probably because they are given after significant neuronal damage has occurred. Biomarkerssuggest that the earliest event in AD is a decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF). This is caused by constriction of capillariesby contractile pericytes, probably evoked by oligomeric Aβ. CBF is also reduced by neutrophil trapping in capillaries and clotformation, perhaps secondary to the capillary constriction. The fall in CBF potentiates neurodegeneration by upregulatingthe BACE1 enzyme that makes Aβ and by promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Surprisingly, therefore, CBF reduction mayplay a crucial role in driving cognitive decline by initiating the amyloid cascade itself, or being caused by and amplifyingAβ production. Here, we review developments in this area that are neglected in current approaches to AD, with the aim ofpromoting novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches; \n",
